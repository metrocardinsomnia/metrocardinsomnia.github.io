### Takayama overall thoughts

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae5f9250-235c-426e-baab-76e8aab64017)

I really liked Takayama. It might be my second favorite place in Japan after Onomichi and I think that may be partly due to their similarities (smaller cities, can wake up right next to the water, lot of nature around, good balance of enough stuff to do without being overwhelming, etc.). I get into this later but Takayama definitely gets more tourists (by the tourist bus load) and you can feel it walking around the old town but I think it's balanced out with the quiet mornings and late evenings where you can just hang out on a bridge over the river and look at the stars and enjoy the quiet river sounds. 

### Day 4 morning: JR Hida + Takayama arrival

You can buy your ticket from Nagoya station - they do take credit card. I originally tried reserving tickets online through JR West's website and 5489 but could not figure out how to pick them up from the machine or even the staffed counter. I'd recommend just doing the "buy tickets in person the day before" strategy. (You could buy them same day too even but you really want a window seat for this trip!)

I did a "D" seat on the left/west side and was initially bummed because the "A" side was getting all the good views and we just got like a wall. But partway through our journey the train moved over to the east bank of the river so it worked out. I think next time I will try to reserve "A" side instead still but I have a feeling that no matter what I pick, the other side will always look better...

I left my duffel in the train station locker and then went to explore the town.

The entire region is known for Hida beef and you can get it in various forms: shabu shabu, grill it yourself, burgers, beef sushi, etc. 

Someone on reddit recommended this little stand by the river "Hidagyu no Komori" 飛騨牛のこもり (literally just "small portion of Hida beef").

The owner sells two things only: beef and beer. He charcoal grills the beef perfectly and you can go eat your skewers in the backyard or by the river and then bring your trash back to throw out.

I'll get to this later but even though I did a fancier dine-in houba miso hida beef grilling thing the night after, I would honestly recommend this first because you get your beef expertly charcoal grilled rather than 適当 tekitou cooked by an amateur like me haha.

Afterwards I went and explored the old town area a bit more. First of all, the buildings and streets are just architecturally beautiful. There's little gutter canals running along the streets and the buildings are well preserved and maintained.

This was the only soft cream (soft serve) I had this whole trip (which is sorta tragic since I normally get one like every other day) but it was really good - pudding and ramune twist from Takayama Pudding Tei. Also I need to rewatch Hyouka again but saw a poster about them visiting but can't really remember any episodes that well since I watched that in... high school?

Another good reddit rec --> 山車 sansha / harada sake brewery. For 350 yen you get a tiny tasting cup (which you get to keep!) and then can sample as many of their sakes in the fridge as you want. I think I did the entire top row of winter sakes and a few others but didn't want to get completely wasted before I checked in. As a courtesy, you're not supposed to try anything more than once (it's to taste, not to "drink" so to speak). They also give you a little plastic bag to put the cup in, very considerate!

Look how beautiful the river is in the afternoon!

For dinner I went to Heainraku for a Japanese Chinese food set menu (4000円). It's run by the sweetest couple ever and it literally feels like being at your (cool) grandparent's house. You do need to make a reservation in advance via their website/email but it's easy. 

I didn't do this myself, but they have a full vegan and vegatarian menu and really go out of their way to make dietary restrictions easy. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a396588-c647-4ff7-b1c9-fec3808c25c7)

You get to pick what gyozas you want (chicken, pork, veggie or a mix), main (I did the sweet and sour meatballs), and dessert (I got almond pudding).

Those meatballs were incredible. Like I don't think I've ever had meatballs that were freshly deep fried and then tossed in sauce and served so fresh that they're still crisp on the outside but tender on the inside. So good. The eggplant in the vegetarian appetizer spread was also especially good. 

If you do sake as your drink (included in the set menu) they let me try four different sakes and then pick - I ended up doing a split of the nigori and a yuzu sake.

They even asked me to sign their guestbook (an atlas / map) before leaving and I (very sadly) signed by Worcester, MA haha. Boston would not have been 100% correct and it's been a long time since Chicago. I do feel like I identified with Philly when I was there even though that was just under 2 years. 

They also gave me two choco wafers, one for me and one for Miche. So sweet of them!! I have to go back and bring them something.

### Day 5 morning: coffee + Miyagawa morning market 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f989608-e112-488c-852b-7037a1c1dad7)

Went to Ember Coffee from a Discord rec. One of my favorite cafe spaces ever (wood burning stove!! 薪ストーブ). Afterwards walked through the Miyagawa morning market and got a little jug of milk. So sweet, so good. Saw a heron and a bunch of koi in the river while drinking my milk. What a great life. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9b3a4e-7cb1-4d08-add0-fb0dcd5e8fc7)

I definitely prefer Japan's fancy specialty coffee shops, but I am also trying to go to a decent number of old school 喫茶店 (kissaten) like Coffee Don. Got fresh squeezed orange juice and their house made Japanese cheese cake b/c I was curious what the "Tokyo Rich Cheesecake" omiyage gift boxes were based on. It's good for sure but I prefer "normal" cheesecake. They apparently also make a really good fresh cream puff / choux creme so I might try that one day. 

### Day 5: Hida Folk Village

So part of the draw of this area is the traditional thatched houses. I took a short bus ride from the Nohi Bus Terminal (right next to Takayama station) to Hida Folk Village for like 210円 (cash only). It was really nice! Entrace fee was 700円 I believe and super worth it.

Feels sorta like Hateno Village and Katariko Village from Breath of the Wild blended together and then blanketed with snow. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a698d0e5-c8ff-4a61-9379-6fbdf7248bff)

Even though I have not been to Shirakawa-Go I would recommend this over that. You can go inside the actual houses here, there's placards explaining stuff, they have live tsukemono (pickling) demonstrations, etc. and perhaps most importantly, you're not swarming a tiny village that has actual residents (was chatting with the sake brewery owner about it later during my tour; he said there's something like 600 residents of Shirakawa-Go vs. 2 million visitors annually ever since the UNESCO designation...) The houses here were literally transported over from Shirakawa-Go too so in my opinion it's not like you're missing out on anything.

Some of the paths like the one on the right were closed due to snow. I think in the other seasons you can go further up the mountain side but it was really nice seeing this in winter!

For lunch I took the bus back to town. Was originally going to go to a burger place but passed by this teishoku lunch spot - I love Japanese 定食 lunch sets and this was a really good one. Menchi katsu (ground beef patties breaded in panko and deep fried fresh for you). Also on my way out there was a little handwritten page on the wall describing their ground beef / hand shaping process and I was able to read like 95% of that and that made me feel good.

I also went to Falo (sibling coffee shop to Ember, same coffee menu and desserts but smaller space and I think less hot food). I got a tiramisu and an espresso shot (as usual for Japan, people don't really drink espressos and you also need to specify if you want a double or single shot, single being the default for all espresso drinks). Tiramisu was really good. If I'm honest, I would recommend sticking to espresso + milk drinks or pourover in Japan though (especially since espresso is priced basically the same as a capp or whatever and most cafes will calibrate their espresso for milk).

In the afternoon I booked a sake brewery tour with Shirata Brewery. That was really fun. It was just me actually so while Fuji-san normally does the tour in English we were able to do about half-half Japanese/English (so like English for all the technical details of rice polishing, steaming, pasteurization, koji room, etc. and Japanese for asking what I've been up to haha)

Afterwards you get to taste three of their sakes. The first was a really 飲みやすい　(nomiyasui / easy to drink) junmai ginjyo using local Gifu and Mie prefecture rice (Takayama is in Gifu prefecture). Second and third were both using yamadanishiki rice from Hyogo prefecture (where Kobe is and I went last time). Both were junmai daiginjyo (so higher rice polishing / husk removal ratios) but using different yeasts and temps for the secondary fermentation and you can taste how that differs which is really cool. The tour was 4000円 and included the sampling at the end so that's the same amount I paid for my Heainraku course meal the night before but I think it's worth it if you want to learn about sake while walking through an actual brewery (with hairnet + shoe boots of course)!

If you just want to try sakes, you can buy little token things in the shop and self-serve and there was even a store in the old town shopping area that had 100 sakes on tap similar to those pour-it-yourself beer wristband places in the US. 

I asked Fuji-san afterwards for houba miso recommendations (regional dish) and he suggested Mikado so I went. You get a bunch of fancy hida beef and grill it first directly over the charcoal and then you put a houba (magnolia leaf) with miso on it and then cook the second half of the beef mixed in with the miso. It was good but lowkey I think I enjoyed the riverside beef skewers better due to my poor grilling skills.

### Day 5 evening: 鷹の湯　Taka no Yu Sentou

"Taka" just means hawk/falcon and "yu" is hot water. In the door flap curtain thing below you can see the hiragana for ゆ (yu) too. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64af8f7e-9bc7-46d5-ba8b-0a8f634318a9)

So one thing I really wanted to do this trip was go to a sentou or onsen. Onsens are heated via natural hot springs whereas sentou are just "normal" public baths heated via furnace. 

I've done public baths before in the US (king spa in the Chicago suburbs), Korea (siloam? in Seoul with Austin before our flight out though I think that closed), and Turkey (I still think about that place in Bursa - the Roman bath architecture, the mineral water smell being so incredible, the extra scrub down you can do at the end and that like soap sud pillow thing they use). But I've somehow never done a public bath in Japan so wanted to try that.

Found this one just on Google Maps in the more residential area of town and walked there. First of all I feel like I restored a lot of faith in Takayama thanks to the walk there. I'm saying this as a tourist myself who chose to stay in the old town area, but old town Takayama is basically just like Times Square in NYC. Everything is super convenient, like 5-15 minutes walk max to everything I mentioned in this post (other than the Hida Folk Village). But the tradeoff is that in the evening >80% of the people on the street are tourists. Whereas in similarly small cities (thinking of Onomichi, my favorite) I never felt that even in the shotengai / shopping arcade. Takayama may just be a lot more touristed since there were gigantic tour buses coming in every morning.

Anyways, it was a nice change walking through quiet residential neighborhoods along the river to the sentou.

Entrance was like 500 yen or something like that with towel rental. You can pay extra for the sauna room (they give you a wrist band) which I did. 

I definitely recommend reading up on sentou etiquette (shower before going in, hair/towel not supposed to go fully in the water, etc.) e.g. https://www.1010.or.jp/english/how-to-enjoy-sento/

You do get completely naked but they are gender separated. This sentou allows tattoos so there were actually 2-3 elderly yakuza guys there but it was super chill; they were there to relax like everyone else.

I would also recommend doing your "towel math" lol - I was so focused on remembering the etiquette stuff and what to do with the towel that only after scrubbing myself down did I realize I didn't have a towel to dry myself off with. I think you're supposed to bring a normal drying off towel with you but as a result I was in panic mode half the time.

It also didn't help that in the main indoor room, there were two baths, 41C and 43C and the 41C was full so I went straight into the 43C one and that was really hot. Luckily the sake tour gave me a water bottle (to rinse my palate in between tastings) so I was able to go back to my locker, get that, shower again and have water so I wouldn't get completely dehydrated.

One really nice thing about this sentou was it had an outdoor deck area! I ended up spending most of my time there since the combinatin of like upper body in the cool air plus lower body in the heated bath plus all the wood infused steam was so relaxing. They also have reclining lawn chairs out and you can wash off a little mat, place it on the lawn chair, and lie down to cool off. There's also a cold bath which I went in for like 10 seconds and then left because I couldn't take it haha. 

A lot of this was just me observing people (awkwardly) but I saw someone else fill their water bottle from the cold bath water spout so I did that too. The Takayama mountain water tasted really good. Fuji-san referenced that specifically during the sake brewery tour as one of the big reasons for Takayama having seven sake breweries in a town of that size.

So I did want to go in the sauna but at this point my arms were like shaking maybe because of the initial 43C bath or something and even after drinking a ton of water I didn't want to risk passing out in there so I ended up skipping. Next time I'll probably just go straight to the outdoor sauna / baths post shower. 

As it turned out, I was able to dry off enough just standing around and then also wring out my towel in the shower area to use that to dry off enough so my worry about a soggy walk of shame back ended up being no problem at all. 

### Day 5: bus tickets sold out panic

So usually you can just buy tickets to the next place the day before but turns out all the Takayama --> Shirakawa-Go --> Kanazawa (my next stop) bus tickets for the next day were sold out.

First I panic bought a Takayama --> Toyama bus ticket instead for 1pm. Realized that was kinda late in the day so wanted to change it to 8:30am instead. Somehow in the last 5 minutes the 8:30 already sold out too (!!!) but the nice onee-san staff at the bus terminal recommended I just go to the JR station and buy a train ticket instead.

That worked out perfectly - ended up doing JR Hida continuing up to Toyama and then Hokuriku shinkansen over to Kanazawa.
