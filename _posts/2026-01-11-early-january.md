Miche just left for Boston en route to Cape Cod. And I'm flying out to Japan tomorrow. A lot of movement and motion this month.

I think the most positive thing in my life right now has been "finally doing things right" for running stress injury recovery.

Started PT this past week - eval on Tuesday and then first actual session on Friday. Friday was really good. Started with a soft tissue massage gun session. That felt crazy intense - my calf was so sore afterwards I could barely walk the rest of the day. Then I learned how to do a bunch of targeted calf / arch / big toe strength and stabilization exercises (RDL, reverse lunge to march, heel raises, etc.). I know I was needlessly hesitant about PT earlier last year but I do really appreciate it now. Just having someone point out what to focus on, correct small lapses in form, explain how to angle the back leg in the wall stretch to focus gastroc vs. soleus helps a lot. I at least cannot figure that stuff out from just reading a diagram or watching a video.

Miche came back from Cape Cod on Friday. Dang 24 hour call is nuts. I think she finished 2am Friday morning, sorta slept, and then drove back. Good to have dinner together again and just be in the same place together again. What a difference that makes. This past week my whole life was chaos, especially the first few days. Eating dinner late, not going outside, not taking breaks from work, not being able to fall asleep.

Just 3 more weeks of Cape Code to go.

I went in to Boston yesterday. Got that 6:40 am alarm and then was drowsy on both train rides but that was worth it. Got plenty of rite tea hangout time in the morning (ok mandolin salad story... ahhh) and then hung out briefly with notch before taking the 1pm train back. Oh I ran on the river in the early morning. Good 30/8/2 (30 minutes of 8 min slow jog, 2 min walk) went well. Did stretches afterwards at the speedway. 

We went to Acton last night. Car swap and then dinner (ribs of course! sake from Yamagata. green beans, panko shrimp, some veg, mi fen, cabbage and pork rib soup). Cantaloupe and leftover Chinese sponge cake and some lychee jellies that I could not open at all. If those were easy to open those would be the perfect race fuel for me since I love them. 

Drove back in sleet / "wintery mix" and that was absolutely awful haha, so scary on the highway because other cars ahead of us would be kicking up giant sheets of spray and that made it super hard to see. Luckily no traction issues or anything but really scary still. For some many reasons, one of my core goals in life = establish a lifestyle where neither Miche nor I need to drive in terrible conditions. Would be so much better if we could take public transit. I would rather walk, even.

Oh yeah --> few weeks ago I loved Miche's Lynn quote. I want to adopt that too - my litmus test for people is how they would go somewhere 1.2 miles away. Will they uber or walk?

Anyways we were almost back and then we got the engine overheating thing happen again. Last time this happened was October, September. And we had just gotten the car back from the fuel tank corrosion swap. Sigh. 

Panicked quite a lot but this morning thanks to Miche's pro radiator cap screwing on technique it seems to be okay (knock on wood). I don't know why I say "knock on wood" I never did that at all growing up. 

I made a cortado just now. This happened yesterday too but for the last few months I've been having a bad reaction to coffee specifically and some other drinks where I just get this gag reaction. I don't know if it's too much caffeine or what. Only began happening earlier this year when I was in my crazy pourover phase (like 1 espresso + 1-2 pourovers per day). But a cortado every other day now is fine. And I've been doing tea only for most of December. 

Anyways, I think all is good now and I just need to get myself to the airport tomorrow. Looking forward to new cities, new regions, new food: Yokohama, Nagoya, Takayama, and Nagano. I will be back for Onomichi again not too far from now... maybe even Turkey. Guess we'll see.
