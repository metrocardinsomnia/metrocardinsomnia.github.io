Miche just left for Boston on the way to Cape Cod. And I'm flying out to Japan tomorrow. A lot of movement and motion this month.

I think the most positive thing in my life right now has been "finally doing things right" for running stress injury recovery. 

Basically doing what I should have done 6 months ago but put off for no good reason. I am proud that I finally am doing things right now.

I started PT this past week. Eval was on Tuesday and then first actual session on Friday. Friday was really good. Started with a soft tissue massage gun session. That felt crazy intense - my calf was so sore afterwards I could barely walk the rest of the day. Then I learned how to do a bunch of targeted calf / arch / big toe strength and stabilization exercises (RDL, reverse lunge to march, heel raises, etc.). I do really appreciate having someone point out what to focus on, correct small errors in form, explain things that I can't figure out from a diagram (e.g. how to angle your back leg in wall stretches to target the soleus vs. gastroc).

Miche came back from Cape Cod on Friday. Dang 24 hour call is nuts. 4:30 - 5pm normal days is nuts too. I think she finished 2am Friday morning, sorta slept, and then drove back. Good to have dinner together again and just be in the same place together again. What a difference that makes. This past week my whole life was chaos, especially the first few days. Eating dinner late, not going outside, not taking breaks from work, not being able to fall asleep. We were talking about this last night but it's different when I'm alone but somewhere else (visiting friends, parents, traveling). Being at home without your partner.

I went in to Boston yesterday. Got that 6:40 am alarm and then was falling asleep on both train rides but that was worth it. Got plenty of rite tea hangout time in the morning (ok mandoline thumb salad story... oh no) and then hung out briefly with notch before taking the 1pm train back. Oh I ran on the river. Good 30/8/2 session (30 minutes of 8 min slow jog, 2 min walk). I think this coming week we can do a full 30 minutes continuous with some optional 1 minute breaks (maybe every 10? or 15 midway through?). 

We went to Acton last night. Car swap and then dinner (ribs of course! sake from Yamagata. green beans, panko shrimp, some veg, mi fen, cabbage and pork rib soup. all so good). Cantaloupe and leftover Chinese sponge cake and some lychee jellies that I could not open at all. If those were easy to open they would be the perfect race fuel for me since I love them. 

Drove back in sleet / "wintery mix" and that was absolutely awful, so scary on the highway because other cars ahead of us would be kicking up giant sheets of spray and that made it super hard to see. Luckily no traction issues or anything but really scary still. For so many reasons, one of my core goals in life is to be car free or at least not car dependent. 

Oh yeah --> I loved Miche's Lynn quote and want to adopt that too. Litmus test for people is how they would go somewhere 1.2 miles away. Will they uber or walk?

Anyways we were almost back and then we got the engine overheating thing happen again. Last time this happened was October, September. And this week we had just gotten the car back from the fuel tank corrosion fix. 

Panicked initially because with car stuff, that's what happens. But thanks to Miche's pro radiator cap technique it seems to be okay (knock on wood). I don't know why I'm typing "knock on wood" because I never say that, never do that, but maybe for car things it is worth starting. Honestly 2000 Camry is doing its best and I appreciate everything it's done for us.

I made a cortado just now. This happened yesterday too but for the last few months I've been having a weird reaction to coffee specifically and some other drinks where I just get this weird gag sorta reaction. I don't know if it's too much caffeine or what. Only began happening earlier this year when I was in my crazy pourover phase (like 1 espresso + 1-2 pourovers per day). But a cortado every other day now this past week has been mostly okay. And I've been doing tea only for most of December. 

Oh I have also been doing a lot of Kaname-san's Japanese stuff. Those have been really good, especially (1) explaining nuances I can't learn just from immersion (2) listening exercises where I then try to transcribe everything (3) actually trying to handwrite kanji (even if it's just on my phone) (4) the toughest of all but the writing exercises. I feel like I am making some good progress where every once in a while I'll get read a SNS caption and be like 'hey I can actually understand almost everything that this person is saying'.

Anyways, I think all is good now and I just need to get myself to the airport tomorrow. Looking forward to new cities, new regions, new food: Yokohama, Nagoya, Takayama, and Nagano. I will be back for Onomichi again not too far from now... maybe even Turkey. Guess we'll see.
