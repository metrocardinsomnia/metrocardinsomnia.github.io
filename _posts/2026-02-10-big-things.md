officially done with PT today! very glad I saw it through; we made a lot of progress in the past month

just gotta keep doing strengthening exercises on both sides but they're fun and I can feel them working so yeah

PT actually gave the ok for Boston marathon but that would be in just two months and I'm going to commit now to not run it and not be there that weekend

like I would need to most importantly ramp up and run it safely. which is definitely a big risk. and it's really hard to listen to your body and quit if you're on a closed course. last thing I want is some well intentioned spectators encouraging me on when I know I am risking my long term health 

anyways I was like if I would just be fun running it I may as well be fun running on the Shimanami Kaido instead and this I decided on my work sabbatical dates!

yes there is more Japan coming in uh two months from now. excited for Hokkaido, shizuoka, naoshima, Sendai, Aomori, lot of new places and of course, Onomichi which i left out last time

miche is gonna be at Bay State in April too so me traveling in April is kinda perfect since it avoids all the homesick and home life fomo 

planning 25 calendar days and thus 23 actual nights. my last trip was 12 calendar days, 10 nights so this will be some proper immersion. really putting as much as I can into Japanese language learning right now. and it's still a lot of fun. 

same with running and writing really. don't turn it into a chore. keep it fun and something you can do for the long run

ok other big thing was talking about the option of moving to Boston when our lease is up in May which would be very soon and pretty crazy with me on my sabbatical and Miche deep in the end of M3 and start of M4 year. so maybe not 

moving takes a lot. I know it would be worth it but not sure if we have the energy for that right now

we could say do a month of month-by-month and bump that out to June. but honestly I would be ok to do one more year of Shrewsbury and then move once to (hopefully) Boston next year for Miche residency 

I guess with Boston the marathon and the place I've been able to set my expectations low and do more acceptance up front so yeah I'm good with whatever for now
