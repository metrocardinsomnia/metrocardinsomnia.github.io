2. do some kaname japanese
3. single leg strength exercises --> oh by the way MRI read just came back "unremarkable" which is the best outcome possible, no stress injury or sprain anymore. just need to carefully build back now with PT adult supervision. that's good news dude. 
4. read (except i don't want to read anything other than virginia woolf and yotsuba right now...)
5. write (which is what im doing right now good job)
6. gym 
7. intentional youtube video watching so youre not just mindlessly browsing. easier done via my computer than my phone. put that phone away.
