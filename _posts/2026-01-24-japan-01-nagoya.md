So with this being my fifth trip to Japan I've been wanting to visit more prefectures. Maybe one day I'll visit all 43, maybe not - no official goal or timeline or requirement, this is all just for fun. 

But anyways, this trip I added 5 new cities and 5 new prefectures: Yokohama (Kanagawa), Nagoya (Aichi), Takayama (Gifu), Kanazawa (Ishikawa), Nagano (Nagano). Gets me to 13 total now. 

I still flew in and out of Tokyo because that's the cheapest. In previous trips I then flew directly from Tokyo to Fukuoka to save a night/airport visit but for this one, I instead stayed the first night in Yokohama just south of Haneda airport.

Glad I did that because my international leg got delayed ~2 hours or so in Dulles and it was nice not needing to worry about that. 

### Day 1: Yokohama

I stayed right in Yokohama's Chinatown which was interesting - saw a lot of Taiwanese food primarily (super wide Taiwanese fried chicken cutlets, bubble tea, jian bing, bao zi, sheng jian bao / hu jia bing sorta things, etc.)

As usual, I was waking up between 2-4am due to jetlag so after being on my phone for a few hours, was able to go out and run a nice sunrise waterfront 5k. That's the Bay Bridge in the distance.

### Day 2: Yokohama --> Nagoya

Post-run I went straight to Shin Yokohama to take the shinkansen just 1 stop (!) to Nagoya. So convenient. 

I booked this ticket ahead of time using the "Smart Ex" app (however, cannot use that for any of the other shinkansen trips I took for this trip, ended up just buying those in the station the day before and that worked out perfectly fine).

This is kinda funny in hindsight but I got to the station early, switched to an earlier train, but had to settle for an aisle seat instead of the window.

And of course, the guy next to me had a perfect view of Mt. Fuji and was like working on his laptop or sleeping the whole time haha. You want to get "E" window seats for this, not "A" by the way so you're looking north. I probably could have gone to the vestibule (?) or whatever the area between cars with the bathroom is called and looked out that window instead... should have done that.

For most of this trip, my check-ins were at 3pm but with Japan you can super conveniently leave luggage in train station lockers for like 400-600 yen so I did that and then headed south to the Atsuta Jingu shrine.

### (Still) Day 2: Atsuta Jingu shrine + hitsumabushi eel rice bowl

The main Nagoya regional food I wanted to try is "hitsumabushi" which is like a normal charcoal grilled unagi (eel) rice bowl but you are supposed to eat it in stages. First phase is just rice + eel on its own. Second phase you can add whatever 薬味 (yakumi) toppings you want from the wasabi, nori, and green onions provided. Third phase is chawanmushi style where you pour broth from a little carafe. And fourth phase is however you prefer it, which for me was with toppings but without broth.

The specific shop I went to was Atsuta Horaiken Jingu located right next to the shrine grounds. I got there at 11am (they open at 11:30) and already there was a gigantic line. I hate lines and was debating my life choices especially considering like everyone in line ahead and behind me was speaking either Chinese or Korean which at the bare minimum tells you a place is popular on Google Maps (it is). But luckily the line was moving and after 15 minutes I was able to put my name in and because I was dining solo, they said I just needed to come back at 11:50 for a 12:00 counter seat (whereas the trio before me were told to come back at 1pm). Counter seat was actually really nice (I always sit at the bar when I can) since you can look into the kitchen.

This was extremely good though I will say that if it's possible to go to another branch of the shop or even another shop altogether with a shorter line, I would recommend that. But maybe that's how all of these are, I don't know.

Though while I was waiting I got to walk into the shrine and check it out and that was really nice. There was even a rooster walking around. 

### Day 3 Nagoya highlight = 荒木芳風園 arakihofuen tea shop

OK this is going to be mostly me rewriting stuff from my previous post but I was so happy I walked by this shop on the way to some second hand clothing stores and decided to go back for it.

I specifically wanted to get some houjicha (roasted tea) and it turns out this store specializes in it - they had three different varities for me to choose from (using tea from different prefectures) and they even had a 50+ year old houjicha roaster machine in store that they still use!

The staff were so nice and I got to ask them about the differences in their houjichas (in Japanese) and they then brewed two of them for me to try. I ended up getting a houjicha a normal (unroasted) ao yanagi ban cha, and a chasen (matcha whisk).

The store itself has been around since 1928 and the owner is like 90 years old I believe. 

This Japanese ameba blog has more photos of the space itself, the houjicha roaster, and the exterior: https://ameblo.jp/shoko-image/entry-12737943207.html.

### Day 3 other stuff: Ogura toast, Trunk coffee, miso katsu, paitan ramen

Nagoya actually has a ton of specialty foods (not just hitsumabushi) so I wanted to try as many as possible.

Basically every coffee shop or cafe will offer their version of Ogura toast which is just shokupan toast + red beans + butter. 

I went to this place called Kissa Morning just west of Nagoya station:

Ogura toast was good and I'd recommend if you enjoy red bean things in general. Though I wouldn't say it's super critical to try since it really does just taste exactly as you'd expect.

In a similar theme, went to Misokatsu Yabaton to try hatcho miso katsu. I got it half half with miso and normal katsu sauce. Similarly good (in fact, I don't think I had a single "bad" dish this entire trip) but if I'm going to be honest I think I personally prefer either (1) katsu curry or (2) purist katsu from a fancy place like wherever Chris and I went to in the Kyoto suburbs in 2018. But this was a good meal regardless and their sumo pig mascot is very cute.

If you're into pourover coffee, check out Trunk Coffee Lab - their owner created the Origami dripper and thus they brew everything on it and have the full colorway in stock.

I don't think paitan ramen (chicken broth) is specific to Nagoya but they had a few shops so I went to one for dinner. It was good and the extra toppings I got (specifically the chashu in it) was a good choice.

I didn't go in (was super tired) but there was a little jazz listening cafe (I think they play records, not live music) that looked super cute so I'll have to go there next time.

Nagoya also has this Mirai Tower as a central landmark and a linear parking running north and south of it. Would be a good hangout spot when it's not so cold.

### Day 4: Nagoya morning run 

Did a run north west to Nagoya castle area and back.

Got to run by the Nagoya Mirai Tower during the day.

Nice path around Nagoya castle grounds plus an interior tower viewed across the water (only part of the perimeter has water in the moat, most of it is dry).

Q.O.L. coffee on the way back - the houjicha basque cheesecake with some fresh cream was really good. 

Next post will cover taking the JR Hida limited express train from Nagoya --> Takayama plus Takayama in general.
