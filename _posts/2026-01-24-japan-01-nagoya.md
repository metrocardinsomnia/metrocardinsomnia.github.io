So with this being my fifth trip to Japan I've been wanting to visit more prefectures. Maybe one day I'll visit all 43, maybe not - no official goal or timeline or requirement, this is all just for fun. 

But anyways, this trip I added five new cities and five new prefectures: Yokohama (Kanagawa), Nagoya (Aichi), Takayama (Gifu), Kanazawa (Ishikawa), Nagano (Nagano). Gets me to 13 total now.

I still flew in and out of Tokyo because it's both the cheapest and most convenient flying in from the East coast. In my last trip I flew directly from Tokyo to Fukuoka to save a night/airport roundtrip but for this one, I instead stayed the first night in Yokohama just south of Haneda airport.

Glad I did that because my international leg got delayed ~2 hours or so in Dulles and it was nice not needing to worry about missing another connecting flight.

### Day 1: Yokohama

I stayed in Yokohama's Chinatown which is the largest in Japan. Most of the street food I saw leaned Taiwanese (super wide Taiwanese fried chicken cutlets, bubble tea, jian bing, bao zi, sheng jian bao / hu jia bing sorta things, etc.)

### Day 2: Yokohama --> Nagoya

As usual for these trips, the first few days I was waking up between 2-4am due to jetlag so after being on my phone for a few hours, I went for a run along Yokohama's waterfront to see the sunrise and the Bay Bridge in the distance.

Post-run I went straight to Shin Yokohama to take the shinkansen just one stop (!) to Nagoya. So convenient. 

I booked my ticket ahead of time using the "Smart Ex" app and one nice thing about that is you can modify your ticket as many times as you want without incurring any fees. Since I got to the station early I bumped myself to an earlier train though unfortunately all the window seats were full. 

And of course turned out that there was a perfect view of Mt. Fuji that day and the guy next to me in the window seat spent the whole ride on his laptop or sleeping but sometimes that's just how things work out. 

By the way, you want to get "E" window seats for this, not "A" so you're looking north. I probably could have gone to the vestibule (?) or whatever the area between cars with the bathroom is called and looked out that window instead... should have done that.

For most of this trip, my check-ins were at 3pm but with Japan you can conveniently store luggage in train station lockers for like 400-600 yen so I did that and then headed south to the Atsuta Jingu shrine.

### (Still) Day 2: Atsuta Jingu shrine + hitsumabushi eel rice bowl

The main Nagoya regional food I wanted to try was "hitsumabushi" which is similar to a "normal" unagi don charcoal grilled eel bowl but eaten in a view varying phases. First phase is just rice + eel on its own so you can appreciate the core ingredients. Second phase you can add whatever 薬味 (yakumi) toppings you want from the wasabi, nori, and green onions provided. Third phase is chawanmushi style where you pour broth from a little carafe. And fourth phase is however you prefer it, which for me was number two (with toppings). It's funny because I feel like that's how I normally eat everything - whenever I've ordered like bibimbop or mediterranean bowls I never mix things together, I have to eat them in like archaelogical layers and taste each ingredient individually.

The specific restaurant I went to was Atsuta Horaiken Jingu located right next to the shrine grounds. I got there at 11am (they open at 11:30) and already there was a gigantic line. I hate lines and was debating my life choices especially considering everyone in line ahead and behind me was speaking either Chinese or Korean. I don't think that's "bad" necessarily but it does tell you that a place is very popular on Google Maps which it was. But luckily the line was moving and after 15 minutes I was able to put my name in and because I was dining solo, they said I just needed to come back at 11:50 for a 12:00 counter seat (whereas the trio before me were told to come back at 1pm). Counter seat was actually really nice (I always sit at the bar when I can) since you can look into the kitchen and watch them preparing stuff.

This was really good, definitely one of the best meals of the trip. The eel was grilled perfectly, both the texture and the charcoal flavor. That said, next time I might try one of their other locations or any other hitsumabushi restaurant in the city in case I can find one with a shorter line since I imagine all/most are going to be similarly good.

Waiting wasn't terrible though because after getting my time slot, I got to walk around the shrine grounds and there was even a rooster doing that too.

### Day 3 Nagoya highlight = 荒木芳風園 arakihofuen tea shop

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48d792bf-80a8-4a71-a0df-4535b56bf968)

OK this is going to be mostly me rewriting stuff from my previous post but I walked by this shop on the way to some second hand clothing stores and decided to go back for it, very glad that I did. 

I specifically wanted to get some houjicha (roasted tea) this trip and it turns out this store specializes in both houjicha and matcha - they had three different varieties for me to choose from all sourced from different prefectures and they even had a 50+ year old houjicha roaster machine in store that they still use!

The staff were so nice and I after I asked how the different varieties differed in taste, they even brewed two of them for me to try. I kinda already forgot whether the houjicha I picked came from Shizuoka or Shiga but I do know that it's good haha. I also got an ao yanagi bancha (unroasted) and a 120 spoke chasen (matcha whisk). I probably should have researched chasens a bit more (kinda just impulse bought it) because they gave me the option of 80, 100, or 120. So more spokes seems to help with more foam for usucha (my personal favorite format which is sorta like a foamy Americano analogue to coffee) but is more difficult to use due to the size. So maybe that will still be fine.

The store (both the shop and the building) are also just old and beautiful and has been around since 1928 and the owner who still comes in is like over 90 years old. 

This Japanese ameba blog has more photos of the space itself, the houjicha roaster (which I forgot to take a photo of), and the exterior: https://ameblo.jp/shoko-image/entry-12737943207.html.

So many bancha varieties! Now that I'm looking at this again I wish I got some genmaicha (bottom right). "Genmai" 玄米 is just brown rice and I like that rice flavor in tea a lot. 

I would definitely come back to this shop anytime I'm in Nagoya.

### Day 3 other stuff: Ogura toast, Trunk coffee, miso katsu, paitan ramen

Nagoya actually has a ton of specialty foods (not just hitsumabushi) so I wanted to try as many as possible. 

Basically every coffee shop or cafe will offer their version of Ogura toast which is shokupan toast + red beans + butter. 

I went to this place called Kissa Morning just west of Nagoya station.

Ogura toast was good and I'd recommend it if you enjoy red bean things in general. Though I wouldn't say it's super critical to try since it really does just taste exactly as you'd expect.

In a similar theme, went to Misokatsu Yabaton to try hatcho miso katsu. I got it half half with miso and normal katsu sauce. Similarly good (in fact, I don't think I had a single "bad" dish this entire trip) but if I'm going to be honest I think I personally prefer either (1) katsu curry or (2) purist katsu from a fancy place like wherever Chris and I went to in the Kyoto suburbs in 2018. But this was a good meal regardless and their sumo pig mascot is very cute.

If you're into pourover coffee, check out Trunk Coffee Lab - their owner created the Origami dripper and thus they brew everything with it and have the full colorway in stock.

I don't think paitan ramen (cloudy chicken broth) is specific to Nagoya but they had a few shops so I went to one for dinner. It was good and the extra toppings I got (specifically the chashu in it) was a good choice.

On the way back, I passed a little jazz listening cafe that plays records and serves food and drinks. I was too tired to go in but will have to check it out next time.

Nagoya also has this Mirai Tower as a central landmark and a linear park running north and south of it. Would be a good hangout spot when it's not so cold. There were a bunch of new stores and restaurants in the park: very busy Korean bbq and monjayaki restaurants, a Snoopy pop-up, Snowpeak store, etc. 

### Day 4: Nagoya morning run 

Did a run north west to Nagoya castle area and back.

Got to run by the Nagoya Mirai Tower during the day.

Nice path around Nagoya castle grounds plus an interior tower viewed across the water (only part of the perimeter has water in the moat, most of it is dry).

Q.O.L. coffee on the way back. Pourover was good but I especially liked the houjicha basque cheesecake with fresh cream.

Next post will cover taking the JR Hida limited express train from Nagoya --> Takayama plus Takayama in general.
