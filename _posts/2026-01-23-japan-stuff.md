This is part 0/? focused on things I brought back. I'll do subsequent blog posts by city (Nagoya, Takayama, etc.) or maybe by category (food, beverage, activities, etc.) not really sure yet.

### Tea!

I got tea from a few places but my favorite shop was 荒木芳風園 (Arakihofuen) a small shop in Nagoya that I walked by, got a few blocks down, and then changed my mind and went back to. Glad I did! They specialize in houjicha (which I was looking for) and had three varieties and even an old school houjicha roaster (which they still use).

The staff were so incredibly nice and after asking them about the differences in their houjicha varieties, they brewed two of them for me to try.

Looking up the store afterwards, it looks like they've been around since 1928 and it feels like that too in their beautiful space that's just as old. 

This Japanese ameba blog has more photos of the space itself, the houjicha roaster, and the exterior: https://ameblo.jp/shoko-image/entry-12737943207.html.

I got the ao yanagi and a houjicha from Shizuoka prefecture. 

In addition to the Nagoya tea pickups, I got 加賀棒茶 (kagaboucha) from Kanazawa which is a local houjicha made from roasted kukicha (stems/twigs) rather than the usual tea leaves. Kanazawa is located in Ishikawa prefecture though in the past (up until 1871) the province was called "Kaga" hence "Kaga boucha" (where "boucha" just means "twig tea" also known as kukicha).

### 真工藝 Shinkougei Takayama woodblock stuffed animals

Found out about this shop from a reddit thread and stopped in on my first day in Takayama while passing the time pre-3pm check-in. 

They're handmade in Takayama and the patterns come from woodblock prints! They're stuffed with rice husks too. The staff were really nice and also let me pick out a postcard as a gift.

I got these four (three of them are going to be gifts) but I did get a cute mouse 鼠 for myself since I'm a mouse and I love the yarn tail. So cute!

### orSlow painter pants

When I was in Nagano I took a local train out to "refalt", an outdoor shop in Nakano, a smaller city to the north east pretty close to the snow monkey onsen park that people go to.

It's crazy how some random store in a small city somehow has every possible outdoor brand I'm interested in (they had Bedrock clogs and Norda trail runners and I've never seen either at a store in person). Like I couldn't find any of this stuff in Nagoya, Tokyo, etc.

I did a bunch of orSlow denim research prior and almost bought some secondhand pairs off eBay but was very glad I waited to go try things on in person because the specific models and sizes I was originally interested in did not work out!

107 (their ivy fit / slim fit) in size 1 was too tight at the thigh, felt limiting in movement. Sizing up to size 2 worked but then the waist was a bit too big. 105 (normal fit) in size 2 sorta worked but I didn't like how starchy and stiff the selvedge denim was. (I'm sure it softens out over time).

Randomly saw a pair of orSlow's painter pants and tried them on and loved them - way softer than the others and a super comfy Gramicci-esque wide straight pant fit.

I'm really impressed with all the details on these - triple stitching, brass buttons and rivets, and above all the fabric itself is soft yet sturdy, intentionally imperfect close up due to the old school looms they use, just so cool, I love them.
