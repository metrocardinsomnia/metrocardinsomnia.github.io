### Kanazawa overall thoughts

I also really liked Kanazawa. Higashi Chaya district (one of three geisha districts) is well preserved and interesting to walk through and unlike Kyoto's Gion, you're not shoulder to shoulder with tourists. Castle is nice, Omicho market and local regional foods are yummy, and the Kenrokuen garden was really incredible. From what I've heard, overtourism in Kyoto is currently pretty insane but I do miss the Kamo river and how we'd just go hang out there in the morning or at night with some konbini beers. I still haven't quite found anything like that Kamo river vibe, maybe the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris? 

I would definitely go back to Kanazawa and maybe next time include a stop in Fukui or Toyama as well to add those cities and their prefectures. If I do Fukui, I can do that along the way to or back from the Kansai area too.

### Day 6: Takyama --> Kanazawa travel

I'll recap my last post a bit but my initial Nohi bus plan from Takyama -> Shirakawa-Go -> Kanazawa did not work because all the bus tickets were booked.

Thanks again to the Nohi bus terminal staff, I was able to pivot to a JR Hida train to Toyama and then Hokuriku shinkansen from Toyama to Kanazawa. 

### Day 6: Kanazawa arrival, Sushi Haru

So Kanazawa is on the Sea of Japan（日本海）so there's a lot of local specialty seafood. One specific dish I wanted to try was nodoguro（喉黒）literally "black throat" and I think the English name is "black throated sea perch". 

Omicho market is Kanazawa's fish market sorta like Tsukiji in Tokyo or Pike Place in Seattle historically. 

Someone on reddit recommended this place "Omicho Ichiba sushi" 近江町市場寿司 ("ichiba" just means market) so I checked it out.

Cash only and they tally your bill by stacking plates, similar to how some conveyor sushi places do it. I got the salt grilled （塩焼き） nodoguro which takes ~20 minutes to prepare so I also ordered like 3 small plates of sushi (think I did salmon, aji/maguro mix, and then something 
else). 

Food was good but overall I'd say it was fine? Like definitely surpassing anything in the US but next time I'm in Kanazawa I'd want to try out other places in the market or even one of the local conveyor / kaiten sushi chains first before feeling the need to return?

There's stalls selling local red Kanazawa crab (not sure what the actual name is) as well as raw oysters. I didn't get to try those but will do that next time.

Okay so this was definitely the best meal of the trip - Sushi Haru. Showed up on Google Maps and looked good and reviews said the chef was young and funny (and that the omakase was good) so decided to go for it. 

They do require reservations and only take them via phone but my e-sim thing I did was data only. In retrospect maybe I could have just used my US sim to call? I don't know if that works.

The first and only seating for dinner is at 6pm but they "open" at 5:30 so I kinda just walked in and asked nicely if there were any seats available tonight or anytime tomorrow - I got super lucky and they were literally at 9/10 capacity and chef told me to come back at 6! I kinda then just loitered on a bench across from the market until 6 and came back.

So I've only done omakase once before in Tokyo and that was fine. This was truly incredible. I basically just hung out there for 3 hours and sitting at the corner of the "L" shaped counter I got to see chef preparing stuff. Seats were split: 2 Japanese girls, 1 Japanese couple, a French guy, 1 Singaporean couple that arrived kinda late, and then 1 Japanese couple that arrived very late haha. So 6/10 Japanese, 4/10 foreigners. Chef explained stuff in English but I also got to practice learning more fish names - I probably tried 6-7 new varities of fish that night.

Specific highlights were the shiroko (bottom right) which is cod sperm sacs as the initial cold dish. That was actually so good, the texture and slight flavor combined with the dressing. Dang. 

My other favorites were trying both ガス海老 and 甘海老 - local "gasu" shrimp and sweet shrimp from the Sea of Japan / Noto pensinsula and comparing them. Both so good. 

I actually have previously not really liked uni maybe just because it looks funny but the uni gunkan (battleship) in the top right was amazing. I think that has be back looking for uni again.

Overall I think there were 12 or 13 nigiri and then 4-5 other dishes (steamed lobster, fish ball, shioyaki something, etc.)

As good as the food was (it was really good) I do think what really set this apart was just the experience of hanging out in this space for 3 hours. True to the reviews, chef is funny - I think I was asking him what 鱸　(suzuki, Japanese sea bass) looked like and he pulled out a fresh one from his fridge and held it up for everyone to see haha. I took a photo but sadly it came out blurry! Ah. Also the two Japanese girls were saying that chef looked 若い (wakai- young / youthful) and were trying to guess if he was closer to 30 or 40 years of age. The Japanese couple that sat next to me were from Hiroshima and I also got to chat with them about Onomichi, Hiroshima, and New York City food (the wife's younger sister lives in Manhattan and we talked about pizza and sushi in the US).

Oh it was also interesting to see how chef "caught people up" like the Singaporean couple that came maybe 15 minutes late and then the Japanese couple too so that everyone got everything but it still felt natural. Takes a lot of expert timing. 

I'd go back to Kanazawa just to eat here again.

### Day 7: Kenrokuen, Kagaboucha tea, and Higashi Chaya district

Kenrokuen 兼六園 is one of Japan's "three great gardens". On a side note, I love how Japan has all the scenic things in threes, like the "three great views" or the "three great pine groves", etc. Last trip in Kobe when I went up to Mt. Rokko I think that was one of the "three great night views" and two trips ago when I went to Niji-no-Matsubara pine grove in Karasu and got a burger from a truck that was one of the 3 pine groves. 

Anyways this was unbelievably beautiful. There's ponds and herons and you can see the pine trees that are supported or suspended to help with the weight of the snow. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f282cf8c-90f3-41e6-88a5-c44357a6a590)

I think this just appeared on Google Maps for me but within Kenrokuen there's a few tea houses ranging from a "normal" cafe to full fancy tea ceremony. I went to Shirgure-Tei which is somewhere in the middle. You get to pick if you want sencha or matcha or both (I did both, most people just did one but I'm a tea person now). 

The staff guide you through the steps in this room with the shutters closed. I definitely messed up the order of stuff even though they provide English instructions but it's ok - they emphasize that this is supposed to be an approachable experience. 

Both teas and the sweets were really good and also the pottery itself (I'm not sure if it's kutani-yaki or something else - the staff explained but my Japanese pottery vocabulary is pretty minimal beyond "yaki" and "nendo"). 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2c4344d-3559-47b9-a8c1-890f39085957)

Once everyone is done the staff opens up the shutters so you can look out into this sorta private garden (as in you can only see it from the tea house, not from outside). That was a pretty cool moment. Even better, there was a big heron in the pond!

The Higashi Chaya district 東茶屋 is another big Kanazawa draw. "Higashi" just means "East" (the same way 東京 / Tokyo just means "Eastern Capital") and "Chaya" just means "tea house" though the nuance of course is that geisha worked out of tea houses. Going way back to the original city planning, there were 3 geisha/tea house districts but zoned outside of the center city. This one is the largest and on the east side of the Asano river hence the "Higashi" descriptor.

It's similar to Gion in Kyoto but last time I was in Kyoto it was super miserable with like so many tourists and selfie sticks and you're really in a "ren shan ren hai" (mountain and sea of people to use the Chinese descriptor which I like). 

There definitely were tourists and most people on the street were tourists but you have space! Makes such a big difference. The tea houses are really well preserved and house all sorts of neat shops. Kanazawa 金沢 is literally named after "gold" (金) and is known for jewelry - in addition to jewelry shops there's quite a few DIY bracelet / earring / ring / etc. places where you can pay somewhere between 3000-6000円 and get to hammer and dremel some jewelry to take back home with you. Would be a fun couples activity or general DIY activity.

I got some kagaboucha 加賀棒茶 which is a local houjicha variant using kukicha/boucha tea stems and twigs rather than the typical leaves. I believe most tea shops will also roast them a bit less than normal houjicha as well.

Higashiyama Mizuho 東山みずほ was a teishoku/obanzai set menu rec from reddit. Really good! Turns out they have a nodoguro set meal (if I hadn't gotten that at that sushi place I would have done that) but since I did, I instead went for their 一汁七菜 ("one soup, seven dishes") obanzai teishoku lunch set with both hamburg steak and today's grilled fish! By the way, the same way old school American restaurants will have a "meat and three" sorta formula, the Japanese equivalent would be 一汁三菜 ("one soup, three dishes") but this place fancied it up with extra dishes. 

Anyways that was another highlight meal for me. I love Japanese hamburg steak in general and they (1) got a really good sear on the hamburg steak and (2) had this very tomato forward sauce (typically it's more worcestershire / soy sauce / etc. focused). So good. And of course the grilled fish (I think this was saba - mackeral?) was great as well. Love how amazing crisp they get the skin and how fatty and tender the meat is. If I'm going to be honest, I still prefer the everyday saba to the expensive nodoguro (the grilled one at the sushi place cost about 3600 yen or something). Oh I really want to go back to Fukuoka again and have their special local version of grilled fish, I think it was glazed with something special but I can't remember. Oh Kyoto had their own version too, maybe with a mirin glaze?

Anyways this was really good! Also came with a little dessert pudding that was local to this area too. I don't think I mentioned this explicitly but this place and basically every single restaurant had an English menu, I just ask for the Japanese one for some fun reading practice.

Nonstop Coffee.

This was a Discord rec. No photos allowed inside but it's a tiny one-person shop. I love how Japan has so many of these one-person owner operated coffee stands. You can hang out and chat with them about their coffee, other places coffee, coffee culture back home. You know they care about what they do and that reflects in everything. So different from the high volume takeout driven culture in the U.S. Oh it was really funny I remember when I was in Turkey the Starbucks would be full inside and out with people sitting and chatting with their takeout cups. But that's really what it should be like (minus the single use cups). 

Anyways this was a real cool spot where the owner roasts onsite and brews with origami drippers + whatever the cooling/dispersion ball thing that Glitch also uses. He has a full 8-12 array of test tubes with different pourover beans in them with sniffer bulbs attached so you can squeeze and smell. Never seen that before.

Coffee is served in a big wine glass so you can really stick your nose in there and smell.

### Day 8: Snow morning run then train to Nagano

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44221560-eed6-4ab6-99cd-9bd8be3ea9a8)

So it started snowing in the morning. I stepped outside and was like "ok my shoes and socks are going to get soaked" so I went back in the hotel and up the elevator. But then I was like whatever and decided to go for it anyways.

Glad I did!

Even with just 5k to work with, I was able to run through Kanazawa Castle (seat of the Maeda clan; there's also a cool statue of Maeda Toshiie with a tall golden pointy hat). You can't run inside Kenrokuen gardens but I imagine it would have been really cool inside. I ended up going across the river and up a brief series of switchbacks and then ran back along the river. 

Not shown in the photos, but Japan uses these little sprinklers embedded in the sidewalks and roads to melt snow with water rather than with salt (which is probably super bad for animals and plants once it gets into local waterways). That was cool to see though as expected, the sidewalks and roads were just soaking my shoes. Luckily I did have my Bedrock clogs to change into for the rest of the day.

Petra coffee.

Another Discord rec, this is inside Omicho market on the corner. I got a cappucino and their homemade banana bread. I actually liked how instead of going for latte art they did a big blob of perfectly steamed foam / microfoam / etc. - the texture was so good. Last time I was in Italy (2017) I wasn't into coffee yet so I don't think I had anything other than an affogatto but this was really tasty. Their banana bread was great too! Moist, nutty, chocolatey. Good. 

### つづく

Next post will cover Nagano (one night) + Tokyo (two nights) before I ended up flying out. My flight out actually got canceled due to snow in O'Hare (uh oh) but was able to get that rebooked via Dulles. 

I think I will do at least one more blog post after that focused on Japanese learning since compared to other trips, I really ramped up Japanese self study for this and even though my Japanese is still like 3-year old level, I definitely had quite a few satisfying conversations and moments where I felt like I was making real tangible progress.
