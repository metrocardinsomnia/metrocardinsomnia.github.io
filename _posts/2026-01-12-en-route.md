I originally set out for my usual east / west itinerary but last minute in December I did a bit pivot and realized that if I'm ever going to go somewhere new, now was a great time.

So I did. Swapped a bunch of trains and stays and now I'm doing Yokohama -> Nagoya -> Takayama -> Kanazawa -> Nagano -> Tokyo. Five new cities and with them five new prefectures, very happy about that.

Yokohama is basically a post flight short stop. Though will try to return there for longer if I like it. 

Then shinkansen to Nagoya. Looking forward to miso katsu, ogura toast, hitsumabushi, 古着屋 secondhand clothes shopping, maybe a Toyota car museum visit. Trying to visit some select shops like R1 to see if that have any good orSlow or ordinary fits or still by hand pieces that fit me well.

I'll take the JR Hida train through the mountains to Takayama and that's supposed to be a scenic train ride. For this trip I'm bringing my Fuji xpro1 which I used to carry around with me the last two years of college. I'm not too sure what I'll do in Takayama but I'm imagining: looking at snow and mountains, Hida beef skewers, find a sento and do some onsen soaking, go to that Heianraku reservation I made.

From Takayama I'll take the bus to Kanazawa with an optional midpoint stop at Shirakawa Go. Can't really tell if that's worth it but I can decide as I go.

Kanazawa is supposed to have well preserved districts sorta like Kyoto plus Kenrokuen gardens. I have never been on the northern coast facing the Japan Sea so I'll try to get to a beach if I can. I do enjoy a nice winter beach, we did that plenty of times on Lake Michigan. Trunk Coffee is where they invented the Origami dripper so I'll have to go there. 

So with Nagano I really only have one night so it'll be pretty tight and somehow my highest priority goal right now is not monkeys or mountain trails or anything but rather just trying to get to a select shop named refalt that stocks orSlow short length 105 jeans. 

Last two nights are in Tokyo. I have the option of buying a bunch of things (Tannuki running shirts, Tetsujin hamono knife from Hitohira, Yotsuba books, nishiguchi kutsushita socks). There's a sento right by the hotel so I can also do that to relax. Bunch of second hand shops around Shibuya plus the Style Department store too. 

I want to make this trip not depend on materialism though of course I do want to buy some stuff. I think easy jogs on the train days will be smart and fun. And just generally getting more Japanese immersion will be fun too.
