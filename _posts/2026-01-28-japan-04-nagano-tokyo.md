title: "Japan 2026 | Nagano & Tokyo 長野と東京"
categories: blog
---

So my last three nights (out of ten total) were spent with one in Nagano and then two in Tokyo before flying out. I also got my flight canceled the day it left due to snow in O'Hare (panic!) but luckily got that rebooked and learned some lessons too.

### Day 8: Nagano

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e18d81-f508-4bd2-944c-0ddaab937279)

Nagano surrounded by mountains. Reminds me of Salt Lake City or Boulder where you can step out your door and see mountains in the distance. It's an uplifting feeling, especially when you're running in the morning.

Nagano had a lot of tourists at the station and most of them had ski equipment. I believe you can take a bus or something to nearby Hakuba for ski resorts. So I didn't do that or see the Jigukodani snow monkey park (where snow monkeys come down from the mountains to take a hot onsen bath). 

Instead with my one night I went to this outdoor shop that I really wanted to go to and basically spent the rest of the time hanging out at my bnb with the host who was super kind.

When I checked in my host made matcha and prepared some sweets and thanks to my Kanazawa shigure-tei tea ceremony thing, I actually knew you're supposed to divide up the sweets with the pick, eat those first before the tea, etc. so that education was already paying off. 

Both were delicious by the way, the matcha (usucha) was foamy and smooth and the right amount of bitter. The yomogi (green mugwort) mochi and ume (pink plum) one were good too though I preferred the yomogi since that herbal bitterness goes well with the sweet red bean filling.

Later on the evening my host's wife got off work and they shared a bunch of fruit (strawberries were both in season and local to Nagano) and taiyaki and takoyaki with me. There even was a takoyaki taiyaki (taiyaki being the fish shaped waffle but with the octopus / bonito flake / sauce / etc. filling). All while we had a fun chat about random things including Boston and places I've been in Japan and I showed them my Yotsuba&I volume 7 book too and they were impressed even though I feel like that's like 5-year old reading level, I don't know.

So instead of doign Snow Monkey park or skiing or even the Zenkoji temple I decided to take a local train like 50 minutes each way to a random outdoors store. Very me thing to do.

It's called refalt and I found it originally from the orSlow (Japanese denim brand)'s website list of retailers/stockists.

Every once in a while in life you run upon a person or a place that just resonates with you and I mean really resonates like when you play a harmonic just right on a stringed instrument. 

Anyways that was this shop! Not only did I find the jeans I was looking for they also just happened to have every other sort of thing that I was interested in. For instance I have never seen Norda trail running shoes or Bedrock mountain clogs in any store anywhere. And yet I found both of them here.

I didn't have room to buy too much stuff so I left with just the jeans but I will definitely be back one day.

I have more photos and info about denim in my Japan stuff post [here](https://metrocardinsomnia.github.io/blog/2026/01/23/japan-stuff.html) but just look at the fabric texture on these orSlow painter pants. So cool.

Quick Nagano foods highlight. Similar to Takayama and Nagoya, this region is known for miso and I stopped by "Ramen Misoya" らぁめん みそ家 (literally just "miso ramen house") that's right across from the train station. 

They only serve miso ramen but you have some customization options: spicy or not spice, normal soup ramen or dipping ramen (tsukemen), as well as normal noodles or stoneground wheat noodles.

I went with stone ground tsukemen. It comes with veggies (mostly bean sprouts) that they actually wok fry to soften rather than sticking them in raw which I really appreciate. Usually when I get bean sprouts in pho or normal ramen places they're a bit too raw for me.

Like a normal ramen place, it comes with one piece of chashu but you can get like 3 more for I think 240 yen? Something like that. I should have done that but just did it as is.

Not related to the food but I also observed an interesting cultural interaction. So like most ramen places you order at a vending machine and get a ticket with your order - this place actually had a touch screen one where you can change it to English, use credit card, etc. whereas your  typical ramen shop's version will be a physical button and cash only machine. Anyways after I got my ticket and sat down to wait for an open counter seat, the couple behind me (also tourists) were fiddling with the machine. Meanwhile one of shop staff bent down to pick up a facemask that some other customer dropped. The tourist couple guy had his elbow really sticking out while hitting that touch screen and his elbow came into contact with the back of the neck of the shop staff guy as he was standing up and he very visibly writhed with like existential pain.

My understanding (from YouTube videos to be fair, I'm no cultural expert) is that Japanese people are very not into physical contact, especially with strangers. I mean I don't like physical contact with random strangers. Like they'll understand, tolerate, and maybe even welcome a handshake/hug from an obvious westerner in a business or meeting or hangout sorta setting but certainly not from a stranger. So anyways the shop staff guy writhed and groaned in pain and I felt really bad meanwhile oblivious tourist guy was still trying to figure out how to use the vending machine. Interesting to observe but I'm glad that was not me haha. 

Ok and on the left is this hotdog place in the Nagano train station which was seriously good. I did take photos but they're so bad I could not post them here.

The case was super snappy and the filling was juicy and porky. Even with just ketchup and mustard it was one of my favorite hotdogs I've had. Oh and it had a nice sear too. 

The station food center also had a standing sake bar with amazake soft cream but I had like 10 minutes to get through the fare gates and to my train so I very very sadly could not try it. Big regret but I will be back for it. 

### Days 9 and 10: Tokyo

Okay, Tokyo. I don't want to bash on Tokyo because Tokyo is really cool and at this point on my fifth trip I've been to Tokyo so many times whereas everywhere else on this trip was brand new. 

I didn't really do that much because I spent most of my time trying unsuccessfully to find a winter coat I liked and then had to deal with my flight rebooking.

First night dinner = Yamamoto Hamburg. This was my second visit and since last year, they moved around the corner to a bigger space! Last time I remember having to wait outside for 10-15 minutes. 

I love Japanese hamburg steak and this place's specialty (which I got last time and this time) is a hamburg steak with a big dollop of gorgonzola cheese on top served in a hot stone pot (like dolsot bibimbap) with plenty of demi glace sauce, spaghetti, and the half egg/baked potato/pepper you can see in the photo.

Yamamoto Hamburg also makes a monthly "veggie juice". If you get the set meal you get a tiny cup of the juice plus miso soup in addition to the main dish and rice but last time I remember I liked the veggie juice so much that this time I paid a bit extra to size up "サイズアプ！" to a larger cup. They bring out a little basket to show you what juice ingredients they're using that month (there's grapefruit behind the bottle that you can't see). Honestly I wish I could get even more of it, so good.

Nigihayaki tea. This place was super cool and less than a year old (they opened April 2025). I actually went there two days in a row because they brew tea as if it were coffee and I've never seen that before. 

The first night I got their houjicha (so it's roasted, similar to coffee) in a pourover format. So they grind it and do pourover via Orea v4. Definitely tastes drastically different from normal houjicha, certainly much stronger. I would compare the strength to the Turkish cay I had all day every day in Turkey. 

The following day I came back and tried a tea latte where they grind even finer and pull a shot using an espresso machine and then add milk. I also got to chat with the owner(s?) since it was the same people both days. The main guy spent three years in Taiwan and got a lot of tea interest from there (he had some dancong lying around too) in addition to working as a barista at various coffee shops around Tokyo. We ended up talking about my favorite coffee shops around Japan (of course my favorite will always be Pour in Onomichi which I need to go back to because he just expanded to a larger space in the shotengai like this month!) as well as how coffee shops in the US compare (way more emphasis on both takeout and volume and espresso drinks). 

I'll probably get into this with my next post focused on Japanese language learning thoughts but it was nice coming into this trip prepared with a ton of Japanese coffee and tea vocabulary from (1) my previous trip talking to coffee people and (2) following a ton of Japanese coffee social media accounts / YouTube channels. I mean you can literally just "light roast" and people will know what you mean but it's also fun to know　浅煎り (asairi) for extra credit.

On my Tokyo full day I fuled for my run with one of these beautiful creme pat danishes. Super delicious and messy but (!) they gave it to me in a bag and I conveniently had an unused shibori (wet towel) to clean up with.

I also stopped by this tiny one-man coffee stand on the street of my hotel called LONFINCH coffee stand. I actually spotted it last time I was in Tokyo (stayed at the same hotel by the Ikejiri-Ohashi station) but I didn't make it in. I had an excellent cortado from Nao-san's Faema E61 (you don't see many of those!! I swear every cafe in Japan has the mahlkonig grinder + La Marzocco espresso machine combo I would believe it if they came as a "starter kit"). But yeah like all the one-person coffee stands in Japan, I love how you can just hang out and talk with the owner about coffee and life and whatever random things. It's just something that's lost in US coffee culture (I can't blame them; you need crazy volume to afford US retail rent and costs). Ok that's true for like all US coffee cafes _except_ for rite which is why it's my favorite place ever and I'm loitering at the bar every weekend. But anyways, great cortado and chat and would also love to come back here again.

Onigiri and Tonjiru Yamatarou - Futako Tamagawa location.

Ok so I watched a YouTube video about this place maybe a year and a half ago. You should watch it, the owner is the sweetest lady and you get to see how they make their amazing freeze cured egg yolks.

But they specialize in making big delicious onigiri fresh for you at the counter. Their main location is a bit north of Shinjuku but I actually went out to a different location that happened to be on the Denentoshi Line that my hotel was since that was closer and would give me an opportunity to go a bit outside the "core" of Tokyo and see what other neighborhoods were like.

Futako Tamagawa is on the Tama river ("gawa" means river, hence Tamagawa) though I didn't actually see the river. I basically went straight from the train station to this giant very new mall area (complete with Mont-Bell, Kinokuniya, Uniqlo, etc.) which was actually perfect for shopping since there's so much more space than the super crowded stores in Shibuya (which I still went to unfortunately b/c I'm terrible at finding things while shopping). 

Anyways walking a little bit past the mall I got to my onigiri and tonjiru 豚汁 (tonjiru = pork soup, "ton" means pork 豚 and "jiru" means soup/broth/juice 汁). I got three onigiri. From right to left, their famous 肉そぼろ卵黄 seasoned ground meat + egg yolk, spicy poke (with avocado!), and then just salmon. First of all the onigiri are huge and I really should have just gotten two instead of three because I was struggling to eat the last one. The ground meat one was so so good. The poke one was good too. The salmon one was fine but next time I think I may have to try the sukiyaki version of meat and egg yolk (still has egg yolk) and maybe double up on both variants. Or try something else, they have a huge menu. 

Another nice benefit of this location was that I was able to just walk in at 11:40 on a weekday and there were plenty of seats. From Google Reviews, it seems like their main location has people lining up before open so glad I avoided that! I can't say for sure I can't imagine a big difference between locations. Highly recommend this place!

Last dinner was at やむなし松濤 Yamunashi Shoutou which is a sorta higher end seafood focused izakaya in Shibuya. Their house highball was exceptionally good (whatever citrus element in it was perfect) as well as their house special potato salad ポテサラ which featured an onsen egg and grated cheese on top. Really good. 

From their daily specials I ordered some　寒ぶり kanburi which is yellowtail caught during the cold season dressed with 叩き薬味ポン酢 chopped up condiments and ponzu sauce. They also lightly charcoal seared these I think since the edges were ever so scorched/cooked and it had that deep charcoal smoke flavor. 

They do allow smoking (as do a lot of good izakayas if we're being honest).

Even though the food was good I think next trip I want to go to more old school style izakayas where you get to chat with the owner/chefs behind the counter as well as whatever locals are regulars there, basically thinking of Yagura in Kobe where I basically just second hand smoked for two hours but had such a great time hanging out and talking to middle aged Japanese people. 

### Day 9 flight cancelation panic

So like on the Thursday morning (before my Friday morning flight) got an email from ANA saying my flight was canceled due to snow at O'Hare. Uh oh. 

Ended up doing a whole thing where I used miles to book a backup refundable direct flight from Narita -> Boston so that I could actually go out and get lunch and enjoy my last day. Luckily, ANA auto-rebooked me for a connecting flight through Dulles that afternoon BUT because I had booked all this stuff via Capital One portal -> United -> ANA there was a whole telephone thing where I couldn't confirm the rebooking via ANA directly and had to call Capital One to call ANA and that was a whole thing.

Anyways I knew this would happen eventually to me and now that it has I learned my lesson to just always book direct; it's not worth earning some 5% credit card reward points to be severely limited in what you can do when your international flight is canceled the next day. 

### つづく

Ok this will take me more than a day to write and actually revise but will try to recap Japanese language thoughts from this trip specifically but also from the last ~5 or so years of self study. 

I basically started during the pandemic but was very very on-off until maybe the last year when I actually started putting a lot more effort into daily study.
