Nice morning and mid-day today.

Cleared the car off last night and Miche parked us in the first spot that gets the most direct sunlight in the mornings so no ice or anything to deal with! 

Stopped by Donut Stand on the way in and got the usual chocolate old fashioned and scone.

Did a one hour run on the river today! I haven't run for an hour continuous since last July I think.

Big loop going west first to Watertown. So last Sunday running east was into the headwind and somehow today it was flipped - I think the first twenty minutes of my runs are always cursed to be into the wind and brutally cold. Hands cold, fast cold, lungs cold from breathing in that air. 4F / -15C plus wind. I actually can't believe that one year ago I was running 70 mile weeks in this weather with doubles and two hour long runs and managed to get myself injured. February is the perfect month to take it easy, really. Stay inside and give yourself a break.

But anyways it did get better. By 5k in things were good and got some really nice miles in between Watertown and the Eliot bridge. 

Hung out at rite afterwards. Oh very excited for rite --> "linger"! Sounds like more space, more seating. Today I had an usucha and then the gardenia dancong. Rose is going to the UK this summer for grad school, wow. Heat wasn't really working today so dependent on space heaters and pushing the door closed.

Finished reading Yotsuba volume 11 plus my ringotan kanji practice for the day. Ringotan's good. Forcing myself to write kanji is at least 10x harder than recognizing kanji. So I know I'm actually learning stuff. 

Drive back was fast smooth, maybe 40 minutes or something? I do like the train but after getting ganja geeded last weekend where it literally switched tracks at Grafton and didn't wait for anyone to get on I definitely have some resentment now haha and also driving just saves so much time.

Car's been doing well though! Fuel tank replaced and coolant issues under control. Thank you car.
