(not too sure what to write here but thank you for checking)

Brian / linxiansheng / 林先生 is a person who:

- likes beverages of all kinds but especially coffee and tea 🍵
- is waiting for the next Delta Rune chapter to come out 😈
- likes running a lot 🎽
- is learning japanese now primarily but also some mandarin Chinese and maybe one day canto the language of my homeland 🈷️
- is trying to read again but not having that much success but is still trying (but did succeed with Virginia woolf and hesse steppenwolf and Stefan zweig and East of Eden this past year) 📚
- has found acceptance that has grown into satisfaction in his weekend routine of taking the train into Brighton and hanging out at the speedway at rite and notch all day until it's time to go back home to Worcester 🚞
