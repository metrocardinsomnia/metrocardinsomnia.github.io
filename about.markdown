Brian / 林先生 is a person who:

- likes beverages of all kinds but especially coffee and tea
- is waiting for the next Delta Rune chapter to come out
- likes running a lot
- is learning japanese primarily but also some mandarin Chinese and maybe one day canto the language of my family 
- is trying to read again but not having that much success but is still trying (but I can recommend Virginia woolf and hesse and East of Eden from this past year)
- has found new satisfaction in his weekend routine of taking the train into Brighton and hanging out at the speedway at rite and notch all day until it's time to go back home to Worcester
